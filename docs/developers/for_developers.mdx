title: Integration with VinURL
project: vinurl
---

## Easy Method

The easiest way to ensure the functionality of a self-developed jukebox with VinURL is to extend the standard jukebox.
```java
public class CustomJukeBox extends JukeboxBlock{
     public CustomJukeBox(Settings settings) {
        super(settings);
    }
    // Your own Logic...
}
```

## Advanced Method

This method should only be used if a separate entity class has been created for the jukebox and therefore also separate functions for starting and stopping the jukebox sounds.

### Setup

First, the following Maven repositories must be added.

```groovy title="build.gradle"
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://api.modrinth.com/maven' }
}
```

Then the following dependencies must be added in the `build.gradle` to reference them in the code. The versions of the mods used must also be added to the `gradle.properties`.



```groovy title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
    modCompileOnly "maven.modrinth:vinurl:${project.vinurl_version}"
}
```

```.properties title="gradle.properties"
vinurl_version=...
```

### Implementation

First declare a static variable to determine if VinURL is loaded

```java
public static boolean isVinURLLoaded = FabricLoader.getInstance().isModLoaded("vinurl");
```

Add the following lines of code to the start of your method that is responsible for starting the music playing

```java
public void startPlaying(){
    if (isVinURLLoaded) {
            playVinURLDisc(world, itemStack, blockPos);
        }

    // Your own Logic...
}
```

and in the method that stops the music add the following at the end


```java
public void dropRecord(){
    // Your own Logic...

    if (isVinURLLoaded) {
		stopVinURLDisc(world, blockPos);
	}
}
```
